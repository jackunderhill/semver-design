# Semantic Versioning for Digital Design

Based on, of course, [semver](semver.org), this adaptation aims to define a useful way for designers to version their designs, allowing for easier communication and estimation between designers and tech teams. To be appropriate for design work, semver can be redefined as follows: Major.Minor.Amend.

## Major

A major version is something that is integral to the application and might take weeks to impliment. Examples of this might be a new section with features not already in the app and moving from touch user input to voice input.

v**1**.0.0 would become v.**2**.0.0

## Minor

Minor features would be something that may only take a day or so to be integrated into the app - small navigational components or extra form elements, for example.

v1.**1**.0 would become v.1.**2**.0

## Amend

An amend is something that is very easy to work through, it may only take a few minutes. These kinds of amends could be tweaking brand colours, swapping out font families or nudging the position of elements.

v1.0.**0** would become v.1.0.**2**

#### Other Disciplines

While this is meant for digital design (applications, web sites, etc), there should be no reason why it couldn't be extended to other areas of design, be it product, print, so on and so forth.
